## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions archived in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

### Known Issues

- Global API queries use a fixed center coordinate, so aircraft only load for one area regardless of camera position
- Airport search returns wrong results for some queries (e.g., "Berlin")
- Airport database limited to 99 airports

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
