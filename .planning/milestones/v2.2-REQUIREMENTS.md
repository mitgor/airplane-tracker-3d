# Requirements: Airplane Tracker 3D

**Defined:** 2026-02-09
**Core Value:** Real-time 3D flight visualization that works both as a personal ADS-B receiver dashboard and as a global flight explorer with airport discovery.

## v2.2 Requirements

Requirements for v2.2 Core Fixes & Data Sources. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Data Sources

- [x] **DATA-01**: User can enter a remote dump1090 IP:port in Settings to poll aircraft from a network receiver
- [x] **DATA-02**: Global API query center follows the camera position so aircraft load for the area being viewed
- [x] **DATA-03**: User can switch between Global, Local, and Remote data sources in Settings
- [x] **DATA-04**: Data source switch takes effect immediately without restarting the app

### Airports

- [x] **ARPT-01**: Airport database contains ~500 major worldwide airports with scheduled commercial service
- [x] **ARPT-02**: User can search for Berlin (and other major world airports) by name, IATA, or ICAO and get correct results
- [x] **ARPT-03**: Airport labels render for all airports in the expanded database (with existing distance culling)

### Rendering

- [x] **RNDR-01**: Aircraft are visible on the 3D map when the global API returns data for the camera area

## Future Requirements

None identified — milestone is focused on fixes and data source flexibility.

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Dynamic API radius adjustment | Fixed 250nm radius is sufficient for now |
| Airport runway rendering | Not needed for search/label functionality |
| Multiple simultaneous data sources | One source at a time is sufficient |
| Offline airport search | Network-based search not needed; local JSON is fast enough |

## Traceability

Which phases cover which requirements. Updated during roadmap creation.

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| DATA-01 | Phase 18 | Complete |
| DATA-02 | Phase 16 | Complete |
| DATA-03 | Phase 18 | Complete |
| DATA-04 | Phase 18 | Complete |
| ARPT-01 | Phase 17 | Complete |
| ARPT-02 | Phase 17 | Complete |
| ARPT-03 | Phase 17 | Complete |
| RNDR-01 | Phase 16 | Complete |
